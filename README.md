## 🌌 Overview

**MeetraXS** is an experimental **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) research framework** that integrates *multi-layered memory*, *adaptive reasoning*, and *ethical self-governance* into a unified cognitive system.

Developed by **Manmeet Singh Saini**, MeetraXS explores the frontier of **cognitive architectures** — systems capable of self-reflection, learning from experience, and maintaining ethical alignment during autonomous operation.

Unlike conventional neural models, MeetraXS is not a single algorithm but a **modular cognition simulator** designed to study the emergence of intelligence through structured interaction between reasoning, memory, and value-based decision systems.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Multi-Layered Memory Architecture**  
  Integrates episodic, semantic, and procedural memory layers using FAISS/HNSW indexing and temporal meta-memory for long-term continuity.

- **Adaptive Reasoning Engine**  
  Performs dynamic logical synthesis, goal-oriented task planning, and introspection through contextual reasoning loops.

- **Self-Reflective Meta-Learning**  
  Enables the system to evaluate its own outputs, rewrite reasoning patterns, and improve decision pathways through continuous self-analysis.

- **Ethical Governance Framework**  
  Includes a governance ledger, quorum-based approval mechanism, and explainable Reasoning Packets (XRPs) for transparent AI operations.

- **Procedural Skill Abstraction**  
  Encodes and executes learned “skills” through modular code synthesis and validation, enabling procedural recall and execution.
